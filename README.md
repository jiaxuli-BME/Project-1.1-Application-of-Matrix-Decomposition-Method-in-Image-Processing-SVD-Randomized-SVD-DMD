# Project-1.1-Application-of-Matrix-Decomposition-Method-in-Image-Processing-SVD-Randomized-SVD-DMD
This project tested the SVD, Randomized SVD and DMD algorithms on a portrait photo and a photo of Victoria Falls. The performance was evaluated in terms of relative error (compared to the original image) and processing time.
